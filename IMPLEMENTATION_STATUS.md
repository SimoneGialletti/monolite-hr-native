- Dark background (#0E0E0E)
- Gold accent color (#FFD700)
- Gold glow effects on interactive elements
- Smooth transitions (300ms)
- Scale animations (hover: 1.05, active: 0.95)

### Next Steps
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. For iOS: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
3. Start implementing pages one by one, starting with Auth
4. Add remaining UI components as needed
5. Test on both platforms
